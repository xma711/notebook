PWM
------------------------

PWM stands for Pulse Width Modulation. 
Anyway it is a square wave for which the proportion of time when the signal is high can be changed (its working cycle) from 0% to 100%.

Application: you can control the brightness of an LED by adjusting the duty cycle.  
The same logic can be applied to tune something else.
