PCI Express
----------------

PCI Express is a serial bus designed to replace PCI and AGP and is avaiable in different formats: x1, x2, x4... x32. (whatever it means..)

The data transmitted over PCI-Express is sent over wires called lanes in full duplex mode.  
Each lane is capable of around 250MBps and the specification can be scaled from 1 to 32 lanes.

PCI Expressed x1 is short in motherboard. while x16 is much longer.
