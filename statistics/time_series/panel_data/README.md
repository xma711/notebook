Panel Data
------------------

Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panel_data

panel data or longitudinal data are multi-dimensional data involving measurements over time.  
Panel data contain observations of multiple phenomena obtained over multiple time periods for the same firms or individuals.

Time series and cross-sectional data can be thought of as special cases of panel data that are in one dimension only.
