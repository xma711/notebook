Amazon aws 
------------------

DynamoDB: a data base service provided by aws

kinesis: a broker-like service that allows data to be handled independently by different 'lambda' functions

lambda: if kinesis is mqtt broker, then lambda is the subscribers. we can right lambda functions in the platform to handle the incoming data.

Cloudformation: to form the vm-like stack in the cloud. need to input the json file (as the database table format?). don't understand this part very well.

Iot: a virtual gateway that nodes can communicate with. the iot module also links up with the lambda module. nodes need to run some open-source programs to talk to the iot gateway. 

Some ideas
-------------------------

Write a mobile app, read and write data to aws backend.
