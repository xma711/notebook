Netbeans
--------------------

according to the pragmatic programmer or clean coder,
a developer should use an IDE that is extensible for different programming languages.

my choice is NetBeans, which is easy to use.

Issues
---------------------

however, when i tried to install python plugin, there is no effect after i restart Netbeans.

the inelegant solution i found is that after uninstall the netbeans,
and then reinstall netbeans,
the plugin will appear.
