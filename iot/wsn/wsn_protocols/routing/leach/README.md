LEACH
------------------

Nodes take turns to become cluster heads.
Each round there are different cluster heads.

The rest of nodes are normal nodes and 
they use minimum energy to send packets to cluster heads.

Cluster heads can do some aggregation and transimt the data to base station (BS).

Leach extends the lifetime of a network compared to 
when nodes use multiple hops to transmit data to base station (some nodes may be overburdened i think).

Leach has quite many assumptions.  
Better check lecture notes for more details.
