LoRa Alliance: satellite services operator Thuraya joins the LoRa industry group.  
other competing IoT standards include:   
	- random phase multiple access (RPMA),  
	- ultra narrow band (UNB),  
	- Sigfox (based in Labege, France)

6 IoT platforms:  
	- Amazon: AWS IoT service, having device management to visualization; also the existing services like aws lambda, EMR (??), DynamoDB, Kinesis, etc.   
	- IBM: IBM Watson platform.. tightly integrated with Bluemix; quite aggressive..  
	- Cisco: (btw Cisco seems to participate in every iot alliance..) Fog computing initiative.. acquisition of Jasper to deliver a IoT platform ideal for tracking SIM-based devices.  
	- GE: GE's Predix platform targets industrial IoT deployments. strength of predix is in its high-fidelity device simulation of expensive equipments such as wind turbines and airplane engines.  
	- Microsoft: windows 10 IoT Edition is an OS for resource-constrained devices. they have Azure IoT platform.  
	- PTC: it acquired ThingWorx. it offeres solutions like asset management, alert management, product relationship management, workflow management.

a rebel alliance for internet of things standards ..   
the article says that like the war of internet standards (which TCP/IP beats the OSI model from standard body),
a rebel technology could win the IoT at the end.

IoTivity and Alljoyn are merging!!  
there will be a new single implementation that combines "the best" of both technologies.
