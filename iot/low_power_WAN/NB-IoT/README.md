NarrowBand IoT
-----------------------

Nb-iot is a Low power wide area network radio technology standard.
It is standardized by the 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP), which also developed GSM (2G) UMTS (3G), LTE (4G) technologies. 

Nb-iot focuses on indoor coverage, low cost, long battery life.  
It can either be deployed "in-band" in spectrum allocated to LTE - using resource blocks within a normal LTE carrier, 
or in the unused resource blocks within a LTE carrier's guard-band.

The peak downlink is 250 kbps and peak uplink is 250 kbps (multi-tone) or 20 kbps (single-tone).
