Low-power wide-area network (LPWAN)
-------------------------------

Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPWAN

it is also called Low-Power Network (LPN).

LPWAN is a type of wireless telecommunication network designed to allow 
long range communications at a low bit rate among things, 
such as sensors operated on a battery.

Examples:  
	- LoRaWAN (the physical layer is LoRa),   
	- Sigfox,   
	- Random phase multiple access (RPMA),  
	- NarrowBand IoT (NB-IOT)

question: what is the difference between LPWAN and the standards like Alljoyn and Google's weave?  
	- my understanding: seems Alljoyn defines an overall network stack, including how to register a device, the message format etc,
	but LPWAN technologies are lower-level communication technologies.
