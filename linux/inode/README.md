inode
---------------------

in unix-style file system, inode is a data structure used to represent a filesystem object,
which can be one of various types including a file or a directory.

(anyway it is lower level representation of a file or a directory.)

filesystem object attributes may include manipulation metadata (change or modify time),
as well as owner and permission data (e.g. group-id, user)
