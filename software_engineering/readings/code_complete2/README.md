Construction
------------------

Building software is like constructing a building..

Construction needs requirements writing, design, buiding/implementation, checking etc.


Correct defects earlier
-----------------------

"Dozens of companies have found
that simply focusing on correcting defects earlier rather than later in a project can cut
development costs and schedules by factors of two or more (McConnell 2004)."

My thinking: the whole software construction process is a resource-optimization (cost-optimization) problem.


Development model: sequential vs iterative
--------------------------

Sequential when:   
	- The requirements are fairly stable.  
	- The design is straightforward and fairly well understood.  
	- The development team is familiar with the applications area.36  
	- Chapter 3: Measure Twice, Cut Once: Upstream Prerequisites  
	- The project contains little risk.
	- Long-term predictability is important.

Iterative when:  
	- The requirements are not well understood or you expect them to be unstable for other reasons.  
	- The design is complex, challenging, or both.  
	- The development team is unfamiliar with the applications area.  
	- The project contains a lot of risk.  
	- Long-term predictability is not important.
