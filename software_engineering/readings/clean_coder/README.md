my own summary
-------------------------

professional programmers (let's say 'professional') take responsibilities.

professional learns its domain of problems.
(myself: i should learn more on IoT and WSN..)

professional says no when it is really impossible.
talk to the manager and come out with a realistic schedule or alternative solution.  
never say "ok i will try" after being pressurised.
"try" is a bad word. (why?? need to read the section again)

professional commits to a thing when he is really sure that he can deliver.  

professional gives estimates: the best case, the likely case, and the worst case.
if cannot commit to a day, be honest and convey the distribution to manager or team mates.

professional keeps learning. 
for a 40-hour work week, he should invest 20 hours for learning at his own time.

professional collaborate with others.
pair programming is a good pratice.

professional is able to use Test-Driven development to do programming,
because an extremely high coverage of testing on production codes
is a MUST to ensure production codes can be modified in the future.

professional uses time effectively and efficiently.
if meeting is not productive, politely excuse himeself and leave.

professional teaches juniors. 
leading them and guiding them.

professional keeps practising.
using 'kata'.

professional uses acceptance test with customers.
this doesn't provide extra work.
this shorten the time in the long run.

professional use automated testing.

professional avoid pressure;
if pressure comes, professional have to find ways to release it before working.

professional takes good rest, a good care of himself.
this is to maintain a high level of focus power each day.
