Agile software development
----------------------------

Agile software development is a group of software development methodologies
based on iterative and incremental development,
where requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration
between self-organizing, cross-functional teams.

manifesto for Agile software development
------------------------

Manifesto usually refers to a some statements that tries to lead to 
a political movement, or revolution.

The agile manifesto is to try to set some new guidelines
that are different from the old one.

The manifesto was published in 2001. 
In summary, they are:  
individual and interactions over processes and tools;  
working software over comprehensive documentation;  
customer collaboration over contract negotiation;  
responding to change over following a plan


characteristics
---------------------

Agile methods break tasks into small increments with minimal planning,
and do not directly involve long-term planning.

Interactions are short time frames that typically last from one to four weeks.
Each iteration involves a team working thru a full software development cycle
including planning, requirements analysis, design, coding and unit testing,
and acceptance testing when a working product is demonstrated to stakeholders.

The goal is to have an available release (with minimal bugs) at the end of each iteration.

Agile methods emphasis face-to-face communications.

Each agile team will contain a customer representative.

In a brief session every day, team members report to each other
what they did the previous day, what they intend to do today,
and what their roadblocks are.

Specific tools and technique such as continuous integration (CI),
automation of xUnit tests, pair programming, 
test-driven development, design patterns,
domain-driven design, code refactoring and other techniques
are often used to improve quality and enhance project agility.
