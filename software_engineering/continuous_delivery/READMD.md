continuous delivery
------------------------

reference: https://puppet.com/resources/ebook/continuous-delivery-ebook

The tools that enable continuous delivery:  
	- monitoring tools, like Nagios and Splunk;  
	- continuous integration tools, like Jenkins and Bamboo;   
	- version control tools, like Git;   
	- and others.

btw, Regression testing is a type of software testing that verifies 
that software previously developed and tested 
still performs correctly after it was changed or interfaced with other software.
