Different testings
------------------------------

Ref: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Software_Engineering/Process/V-Model

unit testing: testing of the smallest testable part of an application.
Usually the smallest part is a function of a method.

Integration testing: separate modules will be tested together to expose faults
in the interfaces and in the interactions between integrated components.
Testing is usually black box.

System testing: compare the system specifications against the actual system.
E.g. The customer (who has ordered and paid for the system) and the user (who uses the system) 
can be different groups of people or organizations 
with their own specific interests and requirements of the system.
Then they can be asked to test the system manually,

User acceptance testing (UAT): determine whether a system satisfies the requirements specified
in the requirements analysis phase.
The UAT is derived from the requirement document.
The procedures are:
1. define the acceptance criteria;
2. develop an acceptance plan.
