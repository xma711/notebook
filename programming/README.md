important things people should know about programming
------------------------

Ref: https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-three-most-important-things-non-programmers-should-know-about-programming

excerpts:
```
(01) Sometimes a great product contains crappy code. 
Sometimes it's the blame lies on inexpert/incompetent programmers, 
sometimes it's because the product was rushed to market/demo too quickly. 
No matter why the crappy code occurred, maintaining crappy code is expensive. 
You will end up spending all your time making the product not suck instead of making it great, 
and eventually you will lose customers. 
Get good people and let them replace of the crappy code (aka "technical debt") or it will crush you. 
Note: management will not want to do this, 
because it's expensive and may be difficult to justify. Do it anyway. 
Note: watch out for programmers who are obsessive about polishing/re-architecting/refactoring code that actually works perfectly well.

(10) Non-programmers aren't usually the best judge of 
what is easy or hard for programmers to do (much less how to implement it), 
so they should just ask for the features they want and then listen to the answer.
```

some lessons:  
	- don't write crappy codes.. need to test codes thoroughly to save time and pain later.  
	- need self-learning all the time  
	- the only measure of programming is the ability to make programs (not 'I've learnt programming but haven't made a program')  
	- maintainability is a key quality attribute of a program  
	- have enough passion to learn, struggle and ask for help, until one day you find yourself learning more, struggling less and helping others more.  
	- good programmers solve the problem in their mind, before they do it on the screen  
	- good programming practices (unit tests, update technical documents, code refactoring) make a difference and they are not a waste of time  
	

good to read some about best coding practices: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_coding_practices


debug
-------------

Internal debug -- use lots of asserts to debug most functions.  
It is like an internal unit test, but less time-consuming.


Logs
--------------------

How to do a good log for debugging?


Over the network integration test
----------------------------

Don't know how to get this done.


Documentation
-------------------------

Sometimes too lazy to do documentation..
