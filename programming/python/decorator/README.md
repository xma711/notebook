What is decorator
---------------------------

Reference: https://www.learnpython.org/en/Decorators

decorator is just another function that take a function as input and returns another function.

Decorator allows us to make modifiction to callable objects like functions, methods..
Exactly because it replaces the original function with a new function...

It is easier to be understood using example.


Note that python decorator is quite different from java annotation, even though they look very similar.
In java, it is called annotation because it serves to provide meta data that do not directly affect the code execution it annotates.
Read the java/annotation/README.md for more details.
