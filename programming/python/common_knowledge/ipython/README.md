ipython
--------------------------

ipython is a tool for interactive computing in python.  
ipython by default runs in command line.  
in fact, just key 'ipython' in command line and an interactive shell will appear.

ipython notebook - run ipython in a webpage style..  
to run an existing ipython file, use: ipython noteobook filename.ipynb

things in ipython notebook can be exported to an ipython file (.py).  
however, such a file cannot be run by python directly, but have to be run by ipython.   
this could a problem in some case, if i just want it to be a script.

to install ipython and many useful data-analysis packages at one go,
it is useful to install anaconda at the local home dir (not need to install it in the system-wide):
