LTE
-----------------------

LTE is 4G mobile technology.

Use OFDM modulation (both time and frequency).

(other 4G technologies include HSPA+, an advanced version of UMTS, and WiMaX, which is dead)

both LTE and UMTS are released by 3GPP (3rd generation partnership project).

Both LTE and UMTS are IP networks (UMTS initially uses ATM). 

UMTS
--------------------

Something about UMTS here.  
It is 3G.

Better technologies added to uplink and downlink (HSUPA and HSDPA). the resultant technology is called HSPA. Later it further evolves to HSPA+, which meets 4g requirements.

Architecture:  
ue (phone, e.g.) -- NodeB (base station) -- SGW (mobility anchor) -- PGW (interface to external packet network) -- [packet data network] -- internet gateway

other important components:
	- MME (mobility management entity)
	- HSS (home subscriber server)

the connection between ue and PGW is abstracted away by a EPS (Evolved packet system) Bearer (a tunnel),  
which makes mobility transparent to the ue.
